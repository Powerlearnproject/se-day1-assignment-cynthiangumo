Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. 
Importance
Software engineers create solutions for global challenges and connect people through apps.
Helps in improving convinience, efficiency and reliability
Enables innovation and advancement
Enhanced data protection

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

NATO conference- 1968
The conference emphasized the need for structured methodologies, best practices and engineering principles in software development.

The rise of structured programming(1970s-1980s)
Introduction of structured programming which aimed to improve code readability, maintainability and efficiency. 

Emergence of Agile Methodology (2001 - Agile Manifesto)
Introduction of iteraative and flexible development approaches focusing on collaboration, adaptability and delivering functional software quickly. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Use needs and expectations- identify needs and expectations of stakeholders
Problem statement- conductinf feasibility studies to assess technical, financial and operational viability
Detailed design- Choose programming languages, frameworks, and technologies 
Software product- develop, test and deploy. Build the software based on requirement and design, do system testing and launch the software for users

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Approach- Waterfall methodology uses the linear and sequential while Agile uses iterative and incrimental methodologies
Phases- the waterfall methodology has defined phases while the Agile methodology uses the short prints with continuous feedback and iteration.
Flexibility- The Waterfall methodology is difficult to change the requirements once development starts while the Agile Methodology is highly flexible and allows change based on feedback. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- writes, tests and maintains code to build software applications
He/she debugs and troubleshoots issues in the existing applications.

Quality Assuarance Engineer- ensures the software meets quality standards and is free of defects.
He/she designs and executes test cases to identify bugs.
He/she performs testing to verify functionality.

Project Manager- oversees software development process.
He/she defines the scope, objectives and deliverables of the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs eg. VS Code
Speeds up development and helps developers identify and fix errors

VCS eg. Git
Tracks changes and rollbacks
Facilitate collaboration

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Bugs- can be oercomed by using debugging tools like IDE debuggers
Rapidly changing technology- staying ahead by attending workshops and seminars.
Working on projects also helps.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- tests individual components or functions of the software
It ensures each module works as expected and bugs are detected early.

Integration testing- tests how different modules interact with each other
It is important in catching issues in data flow between modules and prevents failure

System testing- it evaluates the entire software system
It ensures the software meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance testing- verifies whether the software meets business and user requirements
Its important in ensuring the product meets customer expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts to effecetively communicate with AI models
Importance
Improve AI assisted coding
Automates tasks
Enhances natural language

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
##Example of vague prompt
‚ùå **"Write a program that sorts numbers."**  

üîπ **Why It‚Äôs Ineffective:**  
- Lacks details on sorting order (ascending or descending).  
- Doesn‚Äôt specify input format (list, array, file input, user input).  
- No indication of the programming language to be used.  

---

### **Improved Prompt:**  
‚úÖ **"Write a Python function called `sort_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list sorted in ascending order. Ensure the function handles empty lists and invalid inputs gracefully by raising an appropriate error."**  

üîπ **Why This Prompt is More Effective:**  
‚úî **Clear:** Specifies function name, language, and expected input/output.  
‚úî **Specific:** Defines sorting order (ascending) and expected behavior.  
‚úî **Concise:** Eliminates ambiguity while keeping the request direct.
